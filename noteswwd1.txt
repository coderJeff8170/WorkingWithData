typing 'use strict' at the top of a js doc you're working on will get ESLint to check your code

literals - are immutable - canot be changed.

variable - mutable - can be changed.

literal values are assigned to variables.

var myValue = "myValue";

myValue = "newValue";

variables

constants

every time you assign a new value to a variable you're creating a literal

create literals whenever you can if you're going to use a value a bunch of times
vs creating variables. Use less memory

var is global

let is local

that's why var was a problem

you can create breakpoints while debugging at the left of the line of code - f5 to continue

six native data types on javascript

one numeric - NUMBER (double precision floating point)
stored as two data points, the numeral and the exponent
floating point - the exponent value tells the computer where to put the decimal point

STRINGS - unicode character - while numeric ASCII code - a number from 0-255 (256 characters), 
a unicode character will use two bytes. 1 byte will yield 256 possible characters. 2 bytes = 16,799.
eg: the word jeff would use 8bytes, 2 for each character

BOOLEANS - true or false

there is a difference between an undefined variable, and one that hasn't been assigned a value.

hover over the expression for details. Just assign a default value, or else you may get an undefined error.
